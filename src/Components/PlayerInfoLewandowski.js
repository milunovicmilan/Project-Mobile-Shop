      <p>Robert Lewandowski (born 21 August 1988) is a Polish professional footballer who plays as a striker for FC Barcelona and is the captain of the Poland national team. Having scored over 600 senior career goals for club and country, Lewandowski is regarded as one of the best strikers of all time, as well as one of the most successful players in Bundesliga and Bayern Munich history.
         After being the top scorer in the third and second tiers of Polish football with Znicz Pruszków, he moved to top-flight Lech Poznan, helping the team win the 2009-10 Ekstraklasa. In 2010, he transferred to Borussia Dortmund, where he won honors including two consecutive Bundesliga titles and the league's top goalscorer award. In 2013, he helped Dortmund earn a spot in the 2013 UEFA Champions League Final. Prior to the start of the 2014-15 season, Lewandowski agreed to join Dortmund's domestic rivals, Bayern Munich, on a free transfer. In Munich, he won the Bundesliga title in every one of his eight seasons. Lewandowski was integral in Bayern's UEFA Champions League win in 2019-20 as part of a treble. He is one of only two players, alongside Johan Cruyff, to achieve the European treble while being the highest goalscorer in all three competitions, and the first to do it as the sole top scorer. In 2022, he was signed by FC Barcelona, where he won the Supercopa de España, the La Liga title, and the Pichichi Trophy for being the league's top goalscorer, all in his debut season.</p>
